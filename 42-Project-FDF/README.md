### What is fdf
-----------------
[A 42 Silicon Valley][1] project about creating a simplified 3D graphic representation of a relief landscape.

### Why would I use it
---------------------------------
The representation in 3D of a landscape is a critical aspect of modern mapping.
For example, in these times of spatial exploration, to have a 3D representation of Mars is a prerequisite
condition to its conquest. As another example, comparing various 3D representations of an area of high
tectonic activity will allow you to better understand these phenomenon and their evolution, and as a result
be better prepared.

### How to use it
---------------------------------

Download/clone the repository.

Run `make` in the root folder, an executable called `fdf` should compile directly.

In order to run the program, call:

`./fdf test_maps/pyramide.fdf`
