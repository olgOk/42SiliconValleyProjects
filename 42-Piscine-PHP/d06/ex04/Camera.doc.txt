<- Camera --------------------------------------

An instance can be constructed in the following way:

new Camera( array( key => value) );

>>The keys are :
-origin: The vertex positioning the camera in the world mark;
-orientation: Rotation matrix orienting the camera in the world mark;
-width: Width in pixel of the desired image. Is used to compute the ratio.
        Not compatible with the ’ratio’ key;
-height: Height in pixel of the desired image. Is used to compute the ratio.
        Not compatible with the ’ratio’ key.
-ratio: Image’s ratio. Not compatible with the ’width’ and ’height’ keys.
-fov: The projected image’s field of view in in degree;
-near: The near clipping plane;
-far: The far clipping plane

Class methods:

>> Vertex watchVertex( Vertex $worldVertex ) : Transforms "world" coordinates
    vertex into a "screen" coordinates vertex (a pixel basically).
