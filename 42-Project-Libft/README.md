**What is libft**
-----------------------
Libft is an individual project at 42 Silicon Valley that requires us to re-code some C Standard Library functions including some additional. When developing this library I gained a very deep and thorough understanding in the C  Programming Language along with the great understanding of data structures, algorithms, unit testing, continuous integration, troubleshooting, and proper documentation.

**What inside the libft**
-----------------------------
1. *Libc Functions:* Standard C functions
2. *Additional functions:* Useful functions
3. *Bonus Functions: *

> Most of the the files and functions begin with  **ft**. It stands for Fourty Two (42 Silicon Valley school).

**How does the libft work**
------------------------------
The goal is to create a library called libft.a from the source files so you can later use that library from other projects at 42.

To create the library, after downloading/cloning this project, **cd** into the project, copy all the files from the subdirectiry to the root directory and finally, call make:

	cd libft
	make

You should see a *libft.a* file and some object files (.o).

In order to remove the library:
1. call `make clean` (removing the .o files from the root).
2. call `make fclean` (removing the .o and .a files from the root).

**How to use libft**
---------------------------
You have to tell the file where your library resides and which library it is using:

`gcc yourtest.c -L. -lft -o yourtest.out`

-L takes the path to your library. `.` in this case<br>
-l takes the name of your library. This is the set of characters that come after `lib` in your library name.
That's it. Now run it using `./yourtest.out`
