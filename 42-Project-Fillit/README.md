### What is fillit
-----------------------
[42 Sillicon Valley][1] projects that seeks to make us discover and/or familiarize with a recurring problematic in programming:
searching for the optimal solution among a huge set of possibilities.

In this particular project, we used recursive backtracking algorithm to fit some Tetriminos together into the smallest possible
square in the minimal amount of time.

### Why would I use it
----------------------
The goal is to understand the concept of recursive backtracking algortihm.

You can use functions from your [Libft library][2].

### How to use it
-----------------------
Download/clone this repository.

Run `make` in the fillit folder. An executable file called `fillit` should compile directly.

In order to execute the program run
`./fillit tetranimo-example.txt`
